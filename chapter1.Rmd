## Introduction to Open Data Science

This 7-week course, as described in Kimmo Vehkalahti's blog, is

_open for everyone willing to learn how to use RStudio, R Markdown and GitHub (state-of-the-art tools of data science) to visualise and analyse open data with multivariate statistical methods following principles and practices of reproducible research_

The course sounds exciting enough for me to cha(lle)nge my plans and become a data scientist!
