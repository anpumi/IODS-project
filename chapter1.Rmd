# 1. About the project

This 7-week course, as described in Kimmo Vehkalahti's blog, is

> "...open for everyone willing to learn how to use RStudio, R Markdown and GitHub (state-of-the-art tools of data science) to visualise and analyse open data with multivariate statistical methods following principles and practices of reproducible research..."

It will be fantastic to learn some new $R$ tricks, and also some new (to me) statistical methods.
