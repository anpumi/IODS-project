# Regression and model validation

*Below are all the codes, my interpretations and explanations for this week's data analysis exercises.*

*A brief note about data wrangling that preceded this diary entry. After I filtered my dataset to exclude rows that had zero values for points, almost the whole dataset printed NA values. I found the following solution in StackOverflow:* 

a_dataset <- analysis_dataset[apply(analysis_dataset!=0, 1, all),]

*I now have the correct number of observations and variabes, but this method would exclude all other zero rows too I think...*
